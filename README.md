# Dotfiles

Here are my dotfiles.

I started using Linux again. I'm currently using a Arch based distribution called CachyOS.

This is a new iteration of my dotfiles this time for my Linux management. Since I stated using Linux again, probably this repo is going to have a slow updates, adding the fact that have never used Arch before.

## Window management

### Kwing

I'm currently using KDE Plasma for my desktop environment. The default window manager for KDE Plasma is Kwin, and I'm using a really cool plugin/scripts called [Kr√∂hnkite](https://github.com/esjeon/krohnkite).
